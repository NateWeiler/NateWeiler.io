# Bitcoin Donate

Add simple donate buttons to any website

1. Summary
I would like to add a «Donate» Bitcoin button on my README.md file located on my GitHub repository.

2. Not helped
2.1. Manually button
HTML-code using bitcoin protocol:

<a href="bitcoin:1DF9jgzftTFn4ZnDV2YEjUtZ3uHtBywj57?label=In%20the%20treatment%20of%20Sasha's%20teeth&amp;amount=0.0037"><img src="https://www.drupal.org/files/project-images/bitcoindonate.png" alt="Bitcoin Donate Button"></a>
It's work on HTML page of my GitHub Pages site, demonstration.

But in .md GitHub files not one codes of Meta Stack Exchange answer not work for bitcoin protocol, demonstration.

<a href="bitcoin:1DF9jgzftTFn4ZnDV2YEjUtZ3uHtBywj57?label=In%20the%20treatment%20of%20Sasha's%20teeth&amp;amount=0.0037"><img src="https://www.drupal.org/files/project-images/bitcoindonate.png" alt="Bitcoin Donate Button"></a>

2.2. Third-party
JavaScript not supported on GitHub README.md pages. By this reason doesn't help me:

Bitcoinate http://bitcoinate.org/
Bitcoin donate https://github.com/danielquinn/bitcoin-donate
Leo Bogert simple button http://wayback.archive.org/web/20130621033546/http://leo.bogert.de/2012/02/22/simple-bitcoin-donate-button/

Ironically, GitHub won't let you run javascript, so I can't actually *use* this
module here to solicit donations.  However all of the generated QR codes in the
demo and this README point to my address, and you can always go old-school and
copy/paste: 1BPVHqxcMAdPEtfSHLLPfpqucrDfgCGgD4
